Profile Info Integration Plan
============================

Flutter Page: lib/screens/login/profile_info.dart

1. API Endpoint:
   - Use endpoint: /api/user/profile/ (or as defined in backend)
   - Add endpoint constant in lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart

2. API Call:
   - Use http package for GET (fetch) and PUT/PATCH (update) requests
   - Send/receive user profile data as JSON
   - Handle response codes (200: success, 400/401: error)

3. State Management:
   - Use provider/riverpod for user state
   - Show loading indicator during request
   - Show error message on failure (SnackBar/AlertDialog)

4. Debugging:
   - Print debug info in kDebugMode (method, status, response)

5. Null Safety:
   - Check for nulls in response and user input

6. UI:
   - Disable save button while loading
   - Show success message on update

7. Error Handling:
   - Handle SocketException, TimeoutException, FormatException
   - Show user-friendly error messages

8. Token Usage:
   - Use stored JWT/auth token for authenticated requests

9. Testing:
   - Test with Postman and Django backend
