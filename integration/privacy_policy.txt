Privacy Policy Integration Plan
==============================

Flutter Page: lib/screens/login/privacy_policy.dart

1. API Endpoint (if dynamic):
   - Use endpoint: /api/content/privacy_policy/ (if privacy policy is served from backend)
   - Add endpoint constant in lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart

2. API Call (if dynamic):
   - Use http package for GET request to fetch privacy policy text
   - Handle response codes (200: success, 404: not found)
   - Display fetched content in the UI

3. State Management:
   - Use provider/riverpod if privacy policy is dynamic
   - Show loading indicator during request
   - Show error message on failure (SnackBar/AlertDialog)

4. Debugging:
   - Print debug info in kDebugMode (method, status, response)

5. Null Safety:
   - Check for nulls in response

6. UI:
   - Show loading spinner while fetching
   - Display privacy policy text

7. Error Handling:
   - Handle SocketException, TimeoutException, FormatException
   - Show user-friendly error messages

8. Testing:
   - Test with Postman and Django backend (if dynamic)
