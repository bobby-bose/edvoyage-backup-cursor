Registration Integration Plan
============================

Flutter Page: lib/screens/login/sign_up.dart

1. API Endpoint:
   - Use endpoint: /api/auth/register/ (as per backend convention)
   - Add endpoint constant in lib/constants/api_endpoints.dart

2. API Call:
   - Use http package for POST request to register endpoint
   - Send registration fields as JSON (email, password, etc.)
   - Handle response codes (201: success, 400: validation error)
   - Parse and store JWT/auth token on success (if returned)

3. State Management:
   - Use provider/riverpod for auth state
   - Show loading indicator during request
   - Show error message on failure (SnackBar/AlertDialog)

4. Debugging:
   - Print debug info in kDebugMode (method, status, response)

5. Null Safety:
   - Check for nulls in response and user input

6. UI:
   - Disable register button while loading
   - Navigate to login or home on success

7. Error Handling:
   - Handle SocketException, TimeoutException, FormatException
   - Show user-friendly error messages

8. Token Storage:
   - Store token securely if returned

9. Testing:
   - Test with Postman and Django backend
