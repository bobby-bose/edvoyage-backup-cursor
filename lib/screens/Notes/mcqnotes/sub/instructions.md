üîπ Overall Architecture:
This Flutter screen appears to be a scrollable vertical list of cards, each representing an educational video lecture.

Each card contains:

An image (thumbnail)

A title (e.g., ‚ÄúGametogenesis‚Äù)

A subtitle (Doctor's name & qualification)

A duration (e.g., ‚Äú30 Min‚Äù)

An access icon (either Free with open lock OR Premium crown icon)

These cards are dynamically generated based on backend data.

üîπ UI Components in Each Card
Each video card contains:

Element	Type	Purpose
üì∑ Thumbnail Image	Image.network() or Image.asset()	Shows human anatomy image
üü© Title	Text()	Shows lecture title (e.g., "Gametogenesis")
üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Subtitle	Text()	Doctor's name and qualification
‚è± Duration	Row with Icon(Icons.timer) and Text()	Fixed value: "30 Min"
üîì or üëë Access Icon	Conditional Icon() or Image.asset()	Shows "Free" (unlocked icon) or Premium (crown icon)

üîπ Dynamic Content (Fetched from Backend)
The frontend expects each card‚Äôs data from the backend in a JSON or API format with the following fields:

Field Name	Type	Description
thumbnailUrl	String	URL or asset path for the card image
title	String	Title of the video
doctor	String	Subtitle (e.g., doctor‚Äôs name + degree)
duration	String	Time duration (e.g., "30 Min")
accessType	String	Either "free" or "premium" to choose the right icon
videoId	String or int	Unique ID to play video on click

üîπ Conditional UI Rendering Logic (Icon logic)

Copy
Edit
if (accessType == 'free') {
  // Show lock open icon and label "FREE"
} else if (accessType == 'premium') {
  // Show crown icon
}
üîπ Interactivity
Each card is tappable using InkWell or GestureDetector.

On tap, it routes to a video player screen with the videoId.

üîπ Navigation & UX
Breadcrumbs at the top: ‚ÄúVideo > Human Anatomy‚Äù (can be a Row of TextButton or RichText).

Bottom Navigation Bar with:

Home Icon

Categories/Topics

De Voyage logo

Book icon (active)

Airplane/travel icon

Each button here links to a different tab/screen.

üîπ UI Theming & Consistency
Consistent card layout using padding, margin, border radius.

Background likely white with slight shadows.

All text uses standard font weight and color.

Crown and lock icons are likely .svg or .png assets from assets/icons/.

üîπ Responsiveness
The UI should adapt to different screen sizes:

Use MediaQuery.of(context).size.width

Set Expanded, Flexible, SizedBox appropriately

üîπ Scroll Handling
All cards are wrapped in a ListView.builder for smooth vertical scrolling.

Ensure physics: BouncingScrollPhysics() for better UX on mobile.

üîπ Performance Optimization
Use const widgets where possible.

Use CachedNetworkImage for thumbnails if they come from the web.

Only fetch and build visible cards (lazy loading via ListView).
