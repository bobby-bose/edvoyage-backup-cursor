## CONTINUATION PATTERN FOR REMAINING APPS
# ========================================

### For each remaining app (content, education, study_abroad, timer, ratings, social, search, web_integration):

1. **Navigate to app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/backend/edvoayge/[app_name]
   ```

2. **List all .py files:**
   - Check for existing files
   - Note missing files that need to be created

3. **Deep Analysis for each file:**
   - models.py: Define data models based on Flutter UI requirements
   - serializers.py: Create REST API serializers with validation
   - views.py: Implement ViewSets with proper error handling
   - urls.py: Define URL patterns following kebab-case
   - admin.py: Create comprehensive admin interfaces
   - tests.py: Write 100% test coverage

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Add comprehensive models with proper relationships
   - Create serializers with validation and nested data
   - Implement ViewSets with CRUD operations and custom actions
   - Set up URL routing with proper naming
   - Configure admin interface with list displays and filters
   - Write comprehensive test cases

5. **Debugging and Error Handling:**
   - Add developer mode logging as per rules
   - Implement proper exception handling
   - Add print statements for debugging
   - Ensure all endpoints return proper responses

## ERROR HANDLING AND CONTINUOUS EXECUTION
# ========================================

### Common Errors and Solutions:
1. **Import Errors:** Check model relationships and imports
2. **Database Errors:** Run makemigrations and migrate
3. **URL Errors:** Check URL patterns and router registration
4. **Serializer Errors:** Check field definitions and validation
5. **Test Errors:** Update test data and fix relationships

### Continuous Execution Commands:
```bash
# After each app implementation:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py test [app_name]
python manage.py runserver
```
